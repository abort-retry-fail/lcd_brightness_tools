Basic stuff for controlling LCD brightness via bash. I use these through openbox / xfce with custom keybindings.

No X dependancies, uses /sys/ so YMMV.

bri
---
Simple brightness menu.

bri-inc
-------
Increase brightness.

bri-dec
-------
Decrease brightness.

set_bri
-------
Sets brightness from stdin. Handy for login scripts.
